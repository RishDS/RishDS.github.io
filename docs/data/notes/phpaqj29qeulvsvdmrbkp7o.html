<p>In data science applications, it is very common to be interested in the relationship between two or more variables. <code>Linear Regression</code> is commonly used to quantify the relationship between two or more variables. It is also used to adjust for <code>confounding</code>. Linear regression is a powerful technique for removing confounders, and it is essential to understand when it is appropriate to use. </p>
<p>In future chapters we examine a case study relating to the data-driven approach used to construct baseball teams described in the book (and movie) Moneyball.</p>

<p>We will try to determine which measured outcomes best predict baseball runs and to do this we'll use linear regression. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>2</code> adjust for confounding in practice using R</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will also examine confounding, where extraneous variables affect the relationship between two or more other variables, leading to spurious associations. </p>
